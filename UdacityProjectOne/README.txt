Deploy Static Website on AWS

In this project, I hosted a static website in an S3 bucket and served the content with a CloudFront Distribution. Origin Access Identity was not used in this project, hence both the S3 Website endpoint and the CloudFront Distribution Domain name were accessible over the internet.

S3 Bucket Website Endpoint: http://udacityprojectonebucket.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com

CloudFront Distribution Domain Name: https://d2ssrw6b83n022.cloudfront.net
